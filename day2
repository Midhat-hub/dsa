Given an array arr[]. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.


  class Solution:
	def pushZerosToEnd(self,arr):
	    count = 0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
        
        # If the current element is non-zero
            if arr[i] != 0:
            
            # Swap the current element with the 0 at index 'count'
                arr[i], arr[count] = arr[count], arr[i]
            
            # Move 'count' pointer to the next positi
                count+=1
